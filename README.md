# Heart_Disease
This project delves into the fusion of medicine and artificial intelligence. This disease data is a typical example of supervised machine learning task. This analysis seeks to build a predictive model that answers the question "which people are more likely to have the disease compared to others?

**OBJECTIVES OF THE ANALYSIS**

 - **Understanding the data**: 
Superficially looking at the data to check the content and what the rows and columns look like as well as the kind of entries it contains.

 - **Data cleaning and transformation**: 
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, preparing it feature scaling and model building.

 -**Data Preprocessing**:
Undertake feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline the data, enhancing the efficiency of the prediction and model building process.

 - **Data Splitting**: 
Splitting the data into a train data to build the model and a test data to check if the model learnt on the data it was trained on.
